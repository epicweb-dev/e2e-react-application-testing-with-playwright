# Running the app

## Your task

👨‍💼 It's time for us to start testing _our_ app! But there's a couple of things you have to do before that.

🐨 First, let's make sure that Playwright runs your application before it runs your tests. Head to <InlineFile file="./playwright.config.ts">`playwright.config.ts`</InlineFile> and follow the instructions to configure the `webServer` property in Playwright's configuration.

🐨 Now that `webServer` is configured, it's time to write some tests! Let's start from testing the homepage of the app. I've already got a test file prepared for you at <InlineFile file="./tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts">`tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts`</InlineFile>. Open that file and write a test case there.

Once you're done, make sure that the added test is passing by running the `npm test` command in your terminal.
