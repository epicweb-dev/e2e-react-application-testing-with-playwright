# Mock databases

**This exercise MUST preceed the Authentication exercise** because we are using Prisma to create test users for authentication purposes. Without this setup, it will try creating real users in the real database.

- **Set up mock databases _per test_.** `testInfo.testId` to the rescue! But then it's not environment variable-driven so be cautious.

1. Create `.env.test` and load it in Playwright.
1. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point to `./prisma.data.db`.
1. Show how that datbase after the test run (see the created user).
