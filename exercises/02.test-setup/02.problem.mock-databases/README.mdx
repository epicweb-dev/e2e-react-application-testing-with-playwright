# Mock databases

Problem: Your app under test **must not** communicate with the actual database.

Mocking database connections is database-specific. There are serveral kinds of databases you might be using:

- **File-based** (SQLite). Just point it to a local file;
- **Server-based** (Postgres). You can run that DB instance locally in a Docker image and point your DB client to that locally running DB instance.
- **In-memory databases** (Redis). Run database locally (that's usually easier and doesn't require Docker), connect to the locally running instance.

> Some database clients, like Supabase, might also expose an additional layer between your application and the database. You might decide to tap into that, too.
