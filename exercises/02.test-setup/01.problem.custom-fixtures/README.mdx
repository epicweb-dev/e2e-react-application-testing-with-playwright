# Custom fixtures

## Your task

👨‍💼 In this one, you are going to implement a custom fixture called `navigate`. The purpose of this fixture is to make page navigations in tests _type-safe_! You will use the types generated by React Router to achieve that.

🐨 Start by opening the <InlineFile file="./tests/test-extend.ts">`tests/test-extend.ts`</InlineFile> file I've created for you. Follow the steps in that file to implement the `navigate` fixture.

🐨 Once the fixture is ready, refactor the <InlineFile file="./tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts">`tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts`</InlineFile> test suite to use the newly created `navigate()` fixture.

And, of course, verify that the tests are passing in the end by running `npm run test:e2e:run`. Good luck!
