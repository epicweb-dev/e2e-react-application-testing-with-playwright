# Authentication

## Your task

👨‍💼 In this exercise, your task is to set up authentication for tests. To achieve that, you will be using a library called [Playwright Persona](https://github.com/kettanaito/playwright-persona). Please take a moment to read about it before continuing.

🐨 Start by installing `playwright-persona` as a dependency in your project:

```sh
npm i playwright-persona -D
```

🐨 Next, head to <InlineFile file="./tests/test-extend.ts">`tests/test-extend.ts`</InlineFile> and follow the instructions to define user personas.

🐨 Once you've defined the `user` persona and created the `authenticate()` fixture, continue to the <InlineFile file="./tests/e2e/notes-create.test.ts">`tests/e2e/notes-create.test.ts`</InlineFile> test suite and finish the test case here.

Verify your solution by running the tests (`npm run test:e2e:dev`). The tests must pass!
