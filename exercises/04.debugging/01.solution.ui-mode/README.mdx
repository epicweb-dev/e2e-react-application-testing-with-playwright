# UI mode

1. Run the tests in the UI mode via `npm run test:e2e -- --ui`.
2. See that it fails on the `getByRole('heading', { name: 'hv_nestor_windler70\'s notes' })` locator. Spot that in the UI, the heading element _is_ there, but it has a different text.
3. Fix the issue with the locator in the test (`user.username` -> `user.name`).
4. Rerun the test in the UI mode and see it passing.

1. Practical use and application of the UI mode. When do you use it? How?
2. UI mode is a debugging tool for you. It has no effect on CI, where tests run headless.
3. Recommend creating a designated command for the `--ui` shortcut.
