# Blocking unneeded requests

Our application now has [One Dollar Stats](https://onedollarstats.com/) for very simple analytics. That's useful in production but we don't need this in our tests. It only creates unnecessary requests and takes time.

Let's block this kind of requests in Playwright!

```ts
// test-extend.ts
test.beforeAll(({ network }) => {
	network.use(
		http.get('https://assets.onedollarstats.com/*', () => {
			return Response.error()
		}),
	)
})
```

- Belongs to the test setup, not fixtures? If a test doesn't use the custom `test()` function from `fixtures.ts`, it won't have those requests blocked.
- Consider responding with an _empty response_. Responding with a network error will print an error to the browser console, creating noise. Mocking 3rd-party side-effect requests with empty responses should have no effect on the app (cause we want to exclude them, in the first place).
