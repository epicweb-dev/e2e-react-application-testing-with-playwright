# Blocking unneeded requests

Our application now has [One Dollar Stats](https://onedollarstats.com/) for very simple analytics. That's useful in production but we don't need this analytics script running in our tests. It only creates unnecessary requests and takes time.

Let's block this kind of requests in Playwright!

## Your task

👨‍💼 In this one, your task is to block a certain HTTP request fired by the app. I'm talking about this analytics script:

```jsx
<script
	nonce={nonce}
	defer
	src="https://assets.onedollarstats.com/stonks.js"
></script>
```

🐨 Go to the <InlineFile name="./tests/test-extend.ts">`tests/test-extend.ts`</InlineFile> file and follow the instructions to intercept the problematic request and handle its response.

🐨 Finally, it would be great to verify your solution and make sure that the request in question indeed receives a mocked response during the test. To do that, run your tests in a UI mode:

```sh
npm test -- --ui
```

In the UI mode window, open the "Network" tab and find the request that you have intercepted (`GET /stonks.js`). You should see it having a mocked response!
