# Blocking unneeded requests

Our application now has [One Dollar Stats](https://onedollarstats.com/) for very simple analytics. That's useful in production but we don't need this analytics script running in our tests. It only creates unnecessary requests and takes time.

Let's block this kind of requests in Playwright!

## Your task

👨‍💼 In this one, your task is to block a certain HTTP request fired by the app. I'm talking about this analytics script:

```jsx
<script
	nonce={nonce}
	defer
	src="https://assets.onedollarstats.com/stonks.js"
></script>
```

🐨 Go to the <InlineFile name="./tests/test-extend.ts">`tests/test-extend.ts`</InlineFile> file and follow the instructions to intercept the problematic request and handle its response.

🐨 Once you do, run the tests via the `npm run test:e2e:dev` command. Inspect the "Network" tab in Playwright's UI mode that find the request that you have intercepted. It should have an empty response.
