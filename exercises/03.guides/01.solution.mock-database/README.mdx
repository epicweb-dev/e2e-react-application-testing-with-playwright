# Mock database

- File-based mock database in SQLite.
- Configuring environment to use a different `DATABASE_URL`.

## Changes

- Created `.env.test` and put a different `DATABASE_URL` there, pointing at `./prisma/test.db`.
- Created `playwright.setup.ts` to (1) reset the test DB before the test run; (2) prepare the test database using the same `prisma:setup` script.
- Configured `globalSetup` in `playwright.config.ts`.
