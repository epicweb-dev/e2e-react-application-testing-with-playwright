# Test annotations

Goal: Enhance test failures so you are one click away from learning more about the tested behavior. Put a link to the specification document your manager has written, or a GitHub/Linear/JIRA ticket if it's a test for regression. Help your future self and your teammates to navigate test failures easier.

- `tag` (let's group user-related tests);
- `annotation.type` + `annotation.description` (let's provide metadata about the test case).

Things you can do with tags:

1. Run a subset of tests:

````sh
npm run test:e2e -- --grep=@user
npm run test:e2e -- --grep=@user|@profile
``

2. You can also filter and run subset of tests from the UI mode (the "Filter" input at the top left).
2. You can filter the test results in the test report (`show-report`) by tags.

Things you can do with annotations:

```sh
npx playwright show-report
# And then click on the failing test.
# Custom annotataions will list extra info to help you debug.
````
