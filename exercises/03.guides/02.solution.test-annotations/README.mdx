# Test annotations

Good job! üëè

Please wait for the others to finish so we could go through the solution to this exercise together.

Things you can do with tags:

1. Run a subset of tests:

```sh
npm test -- --grep=@user
npm test -- --grep=@user|@profile
```

2. You can also filter and run subset of tests from the UI mode (the "Filter" input at the top left).
3. You can filter the test results in the test report (`show-report`) by tags.

Things you can do with annotations:

```sh
npx playwright show-report
# And then click on the failing test.
# Custom annotataions will list extra info to help you debug.
```
