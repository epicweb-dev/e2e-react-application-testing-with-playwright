# Test annotations

Goal: Enhance test failures so you are one click away from learning more about the tested behavior. Put a link to the specification document your manager has written, or a GitHub/Linear/JIRA ticket if it's a test for regression. Help your future self and your teammates to navigate test failures easier.

- `tag` (let's group user-related tests);
- `annotation.type` + `annotation.description` (let's provide metadata about the test case).
