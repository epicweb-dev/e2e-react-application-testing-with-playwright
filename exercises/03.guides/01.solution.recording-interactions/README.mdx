# Recording interactions

1. Install Playwright extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows for much easier test generation, including "Record at cursor", which is just straight magic.
1. Open a new test file and an empty test case there.
1. `authenticate()` as a user.
1. Click "Record at cursor" in the Testing extension. Recording at cursor because we want to preserve the test setup (authentication).
1. Interact with the app, add assertions.
1. Finish and see the test generated!

Then, say we've made a mistake while recording our interactions. Not to worry:

1. Go to the last _correct_ statement.
1. Remove the incorrect output.
1. Press "Record at cursor".
1. Correct the mistake.
1. Close the window.
