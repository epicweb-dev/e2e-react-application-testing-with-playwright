# Getting started

1. Install `@playwright/test`.
1. The difference between `playwright` and `@playwright/test` packages. Which one should you use?
1. Simple `playwright.config.ts` (should we use `playwright init`?).
1. Add a new `test:e2e` script in package.json.
1. Create a new test file at `tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts`
1. `await page.goto('https://epicweb.dev')`
1. Assert that "Full Stack Workshop Training for Professional Web Developers" heading is visible.
1. Run the tests.

The goal of this exercise is to:

- Rehearse the structure of the test in Playwright;
- Write an accessible selector for elements.
- Write a promisified assertion on elements.
