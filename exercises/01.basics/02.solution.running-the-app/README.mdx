# Running the app

1. Add `webServer` to `playwright.config.ts` and configure it to spawn our app before tests.
1. Add `use.baseURL` so relative requests in `page.goto()` are resolved against our app's URL.
1. Refactor `tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts` to navigate to the app's homepage and assert on the heading visible there.
1. Run the tests.
