# Custom fixtures

## Summary

1. Implement the new `navigate` fixture in `tests/text-extend.ts`. Use generated type definitions from React Router for type-safe navigation in tests. Build the app to generate the type definitions.
1. Change the existing test at `tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts` to use the new `navigate` fixture instead of `page`. Notice the route suggestions! Neat.
