# Running the app

## Summary

1. Introduce to the Epic Stack app, briefly.

---

1. Changes in `playwright.config.ts`, mainly:
  1. `PORT` at which the app will be running. `use.baseURL` to we can use relative URLs in our tests. 
  1. The `webServer` option to spawn our app and wait at the given `PORT`.
  1. `reuseExistingServer` allows us to use an already running app locally for faster tests.
  1. `testDir` set to `./tests/e2e` since our app now also has other types of tests.

---

1. New test at `tests/e2e/homepage.test.ts`. We need to test our app, not running `epicweb.dev`.
1. The basic structure of the test remains the same though:
  1. Visit the homepage `/` (since we enabled relative URLs).
  1. Assert that the heading text is visible to the user.
1. Verify the test via `npm run test:e2e`.
