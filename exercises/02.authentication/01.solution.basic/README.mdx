# Basic

- Testing a basic (email+password) authentication.

## Summary

1. Create new test at `tests/e2e/authentication-basic.test.ts`.
1. Create a new test case for successful authentication using email and password.
1. In the test, use the existing `createUser()` utility, which generates a new user and creates it in the database.
1. Log in by filling the log in form as the user would.
1. Talk about _locators_ in Playwright. They are promises to values.
1. Assert that the authentication is successful based on the user profile link being visible on the screen.
1. `npm run test:e2e:run`.

---

1. Another test case in the same file focused on displaying an error when authentication fails.
1. Similar steps but _no setup_ so the user doesn't exist.
1. Assert the error message being shown (correct _role_ and text).
1. `npm run test:e2e:run`.
