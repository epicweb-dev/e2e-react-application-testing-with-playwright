# Basic

- Testing a basic (email+password) authentication.

## Summary

1. In `db-utils,` implement the `createUser` utility, following the steps.
1. Mention the `asyncDispose` for clean up of the created user. Handy!
1. `createUser` creates a _test_ user. You might've heard that "test users" should be avoided. Talk about the difference between the two (we aren't creating a user that acts and asserts on internals; "test user" simply means an actual user record we created for test purposes).

---

1. Create new test at `tests/e2e/authentication-basic.test.ts`.
1. Create a new test case for successful authentication using email and password.
1. In the test, use the newly created `createUser()` utility, which generates a new user and creates it in the database.
1. Log in by filling the log in form as the user would.
1. Assert that the authentication is successful based on the user profile link being visible on the screen.
1. `npm run test:e2e:run`.

---

1. Another test case in the same file focused on displaying an error when authentication fails.
1. Similar steps but _no setup_ so the user doesn't exist.
1. Assert the error message being shown (correct _role_ and text).
1. `npm run test:e2e:run`.
